# Roll_a_Ball

## About 
This app is a simple evolution of the first game example of UNITY tutorial.

I made this app to demonstrate in an easy way, some basic concepts used in the majority of games.

Here you will see:

* Door concept using triggers
* Collision
* Two cameras alternated by triggers
* Global Camera view
* Mini Map implemented
* Refletion using refletion probe
